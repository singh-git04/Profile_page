# My Personal Portfolio Website

Hi there! Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio page. This project was a major step for me in learning front-end development, where my main goal was to build a complete, responsive website from scratch using just HTML and CSS.

## About This Project

I designed and built this single-page site to be clean, modern, and easy to navigate. The idea was to create a professional-looking space to list my skills, education, and projects.

The entire project is built with:

* **HTML5:** I focused on using semantic tags like `<header>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` to structure the content logically.
* **CSS3:** I wrote all the CSS from scratch to handle the styling, layout, and colors. I used modern features like CSS Variables to manage the color palette and added subtle transitions for the interactive hover effects on the cards.
* **Google Fonts:** I brought in the 'Poppins' font to give the site a clean, professional typeface.

## My Learning Journey

This project was more than just writing code; it was about truly understanding the fundamentals. Here are some of the key concepts I focused on:

* **Writing Clean, Organized Code:** I practiced keeping my HTML structured and my CSS organized and efficient, avoiding repetitive code (the DRY principle).
* **Mastering CSS Layouts:** I spent a lot of time working with the CSS Box Model, using `padding` and `margin` to get the spacing right, and `margin: auto` to perfectly center the main content container.
* **Responsive Design:** A huge focus for me was making sure the website looks and works great on both large desktop screens and smaller mobile devices.
* **Creating an Interactive Feel:** I learned how to use CSS `transitions` and `transforms` to add simple animations that make the site feel more dynamic and responsive to user interaction.
